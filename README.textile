h1. view_testify

That's "test-a-fie." This plugin auto-generates TestUnit view tests by interrogating your existing
views. It looks through your views, mocking all instance variables and stubbing all helper method
calls and routes off @template@.

Pardon our dust; this is alpha software. But, it serves as a handy, time-saving first pass at
writing your view specs.

You can add extra template stubs, if you need, with the @--stubs@ option.

Current limitations:

# you have to add the @--force@ option for subsequent runs
# mocking "dot chains" doesn't work right now

<code>
  Example:
      ./script/generate view_testify [--stubs=stub1,stub2,stub3]

      This will create:
          test/views/[each_view_dir]/[each_view]
</code>
</pre>
